  summary: [
    `I have been actively educating myself in the field of frontend development (HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, React) since 2024. So far, I have completed approximately 322 hours of training
and implemented my first project. In a two-person team guided by a mentor, we designed
and developed a web application for mental health tracking. In the app, the user selects a
flower based on their current mood for each day, which is saved to a calendar. Throughout
the day, the user can interact with the flower to reflect on their self-care. The app is built
with React, and is using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs, and localStorage.`,

    `I bring analytical approach, systematic work with data (R language), and communication in
an international team from a scientific background (Ph.D. studies).`,
